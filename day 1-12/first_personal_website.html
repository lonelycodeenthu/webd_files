    <h1 align="center">Welcome to my first personal website.</h1>
    <p>I built this website using only HTML because i haven't started learning css yet. If i find anything interesting or useful related to math or computers or webdevelopment, I'll put it here and I'll also write about my webdev journey and how far I've progressed so far.I'll be using github to get this website online. This feels so fun.</p>
