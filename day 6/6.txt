1.) we can give two classes to an element (for eg <div class="class10 class10A" ) by using space beteween the names of two classes.

2.) two elements can't have the same id. they can have the same classes tho.

3.) in css stylesheet use .[class_name]{} for class styling and #[element_id]{} for particular element id styling.

4. )type #[element id] after the url of a website and the browser will take you directly to that element.
