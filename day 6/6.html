        hi this is my day 6. i kind of gave in to my temptations but here i am now, trying to correct my mistakes. i
        deeply regret fucking this up. hope it never happens again.

    <span id="intro2" class="class1 class2">this is 2nd para and it has two classes. and im gonna try giving two
        different colors to both classes. let's see what happens.<p>
            so i gave pink color to the first class and green color to the second class but the color appearing on the
            screen is green, so ig it took into account the class which is not common. changing the order of assignment
            of classes didn't make any difference.
